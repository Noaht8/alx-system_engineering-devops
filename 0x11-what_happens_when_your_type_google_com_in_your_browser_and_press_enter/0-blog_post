DNS request
Your browser sends a DNS request to a DNS server. A DNS server is a computer that translates domain names into IP addresses. The IP address is a unique number that identifies a computer on the internet.

TCP/IP
Once the DNS server has returned the IP address, your browser uses TCP/IP to connect to the web server. TCP/IP is a set of protocols that govern how data is exchanged between computers on the internet.

Firewall
The web server may be behind a firewall. A firewall is a security device that protects a computer or network from unauthorized access. The firewall may block your browser from connecting to the web server if it does not recognize the request.

HTTPS/SSL
If the web server is using HTTPS, your browser will initiate an SSL handshake. SSL is a security protocol that encrypts data exchanged between your browser and the web server. This helps to protect your privacy and security.

Load-balancer
The web server may be behind a load balancer. A load balancer is a device that distributes traffic across multiple web servers. This helps to improve performance and reliability.

Web server
The web server receives your request and sends back a response. The response may contain the HTML code for a web page, an image, or other data.

Application server
If the web page requires dynamic content, such as a login page or a shopping cart, the request will be forwarded to an application server. The application server will process the request and generate the appropriate response.

Database
If the web page requires data from a database, the application server will query the database and retrieve the data. The data will then be returned to the browser.

Once the browser has received the response, it will render the web page on your screen.
